All files should be saved with filenames like so:  

    problem-<number>-<letter>.py
    problem-<number>-<letter>.input (optional)

example:

    problem-3-a.py
    problem-3-a.input

when running make, will run all problems with their input (if applicable) and store their output in

    problem-<number>-<letter>.run-output

Programs that provide their own .output will not be run. This allows things like images to be generated and stored in tex


Note that '-<letter>' is optional, it's just part of the name




Need to also generate a .tex file with input/output for
